## 🛠️ My Projects

### **Lending Club Loan Default Prediction**
This project uses historical LendingClub loan data to predict whether a borrower will repay a loan or default. Since LendingClub is the world’s largest peer-to-peer lending platform, understanding loan default risk is extremely important for reducing financial loss and improving lending decisions.

Using real loan records, the goal of this project was to build a machine learning model that can classify borrowers into:
- Likely to repay  
- Likely to default (charge-off)

This helps lenders assess risk before approving loans.

**What I Did**
- Collected and explored the LendingClub dataset from Kaggle  
- Performed data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering  
- Converted “loan_status” into a binary classification label  
- Built and trained a deep learning classification model using TensorFlow  
- Evaluated the model using key classification metrics  

**Outcome**  
The project successfully demonstrates how machine learning can help financial institutions make smarter lending decisions and reduce losses by predicting borrower risk in advance.

### **SQL Sales Analytics Project (PostgreSQL)**
This project focuses on analyzing business performance using three core datasets: Customers, Products, and Sales. The goal is to extract meaningful and actionable insights using PostgreSQL, helping decision-makers understand performance trends, customer behavior, and profitability.

**Project Objective**
To answer key business questions such as:
- Which regions generate the highest sales?
- Which products contribute the most revenue and profit?
- Which customer segments perform best?
- Where are performance gaps, and how can they be improved?

These insights support smart business strategies, marketing decisions, and resource planning.

**Outcome**  
This project demonstrates how SQL can transform raw business data into valuable insights for performance tracking and strategic growth.

## 🧠 Current Focus
I am currently expanding my skills in:
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Fine-tuning custom AI models
- AI Agents

I’m actively working on real-world projects in these areas and will be adding them to this portfolio soon.
